This is a library for websockets clients written in Hack. It is inspired by the
phpws project (https://github.com/Devristo/phpws) to try and make it easy to
interact with websocket servers in Hack.

Major Differences from phpws:
 * Written in Hack strict
   * Everything is strongly typed
   * Uses async functions to simulate event loops
 * No External Dependencies
 * Only supports RFC 6455 Websockets
 * No Websocket Server support
 * No composer support (yet)
 * Probably has more bugs

Planned Features:
 * Examples. There's only one, using the Chrome Debugger Protocol
 * Comments. There really aren't any
 * Tests. There definitely aren't any

Known Problems:
 * This library uses classes not present in the Hack hhi files at the time I am
   writing this. You will need to manually add SplQueue and JSON_FB_COLLECTIONS
   entries
